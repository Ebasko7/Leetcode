"""Example 3: 844. Backspace String Compare

Given two strings s and t, return true if they are equal when both are typed into empty text editors. '#' means a backspace character.

For example, given s = "ab#c" and t = "ad#c", return true. Because of the backspace, the strings are both equal to "ac"."""
